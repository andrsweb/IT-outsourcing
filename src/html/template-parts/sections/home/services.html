					IT outsourcing refers to the practice of hiring another company or individual to handle IT-related tasks or services on behalf of your company. This can include software development, network and infrastructure management, technical support, and more. <br>
					By outsourcing IT functions, companies can benefit from access to specialized expertise, increased efficiency and productivity, and cost savings. It also allows companies to focus on their core competencies, rather than spending time and resources on IT-related tasks. <br>
					IT outsourcing can involve domestic or international service providers, and the services provided can range from individual projects to long-term partnerships. <br><br>
